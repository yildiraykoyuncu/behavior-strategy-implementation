# [Find Multiples of a Number](https://www.codewars.com/kata/58ca658cc0d6401f2700045f)

Funt
describe the function's behavior in your own words.

## Syntax

> functionName(`type`, `type`, ...) -> `type`

### Parameters

**paramName**: `paramType`

- describe the parameter

### Return Value: `type`

describe the return value

## Examples

Write a couple use cases that show how this function behaves. try to write examples that show _edge cases_ (scenarios when a function behaves different than you'd expect).  This will help you and others better understand the function.

You might find that studying the kata's test cases helps you to think of interesting use cases.  In software development, code behavior and use cases are often described using tests.  Practice thinking of [edge cases](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dont-forget-edge-cases/), it's good for you ;)

### Strategy

Describe what strategy they used to pass this challenge.  Careful! your strategy description should not mention what code they wrote to solve the challenge. Practice describing their strategy at a higher level: a simple way to understand _strategy_ is to think of the important steps between the argument values and the return values.

For example if they use a `for` loop you won't mention that `i` was incremented, but you might decide to mention how the final result changes at each iteration.

### Implementation

Describe how the user implemented their strategy. ie. how did they use JS language features to go from the arguments to the return value, following the strategy described above.

**name of language feature**: how it was used to implement their strategy

### Possible Refactors

List a couple other language features they could have used without changing their strategy.  For example: `while` loops and `for` loops can often be interchanged. `if else`, `switch case` and `_ ? _ : _` can sometimes be interchanged.

You don't need to actually rewrite the function, or even be 100% that they could be interchanged. The goal of this section is to get you exploring different JS language features and thinking of different ways to write the same code.

**name of language feature**: how it was used to implement their strategy

### Possible Refactors

Mention a few different ways this strategy could have been implemented.  A good way to get started is listing a couple other language features they could have used instead.  For example: `while` loops and `for` loops can often be interchanged, while keeping an iterative strategy. `if else`, `switch case` and `_ ? _ : _` can often be interchanged as well.

You don't need to actually rewrite the function, or even be 100% that they could be interchanged. The goal of this section is to get you exploring different JS language features and thinking of different ways to write the same code.
